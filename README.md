# Orchard CMS 1.6

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused project aimed at delivering applications and reusable 
components on the ASP.NET platform. It will create shared components for building ASP.NET applications and 
extensions, and specific applications that leverage these components to meet the needs of end-users, 
scripters, and developers. Additionally, we seek to create partnerships with existing application authors 
to help them achieve their goals. Orchard is delivered as part of the ASP.NET Open Source Gallery under the 
Outercurve Foundation. It is licensed under a New BSD license, which is approved by the OSI.
